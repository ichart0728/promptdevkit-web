PromptDevKit Web provides a Supabase-backed platform for managing generative AI prompts, teams, and plan limits so small teams or solo builders can ship MVPs quickly. The codebase is a pnpm monorepo centered on a Vite/React frontend in `apps/frontend`, integrating Supabase auth/storage, TanStack Router/Query, and shared form/tooling wrappers. Supabase SQL migrations, seeds, and policies live under `supabase/`, with RLS-first design and plan_limit data enforcing subscription constraints.
